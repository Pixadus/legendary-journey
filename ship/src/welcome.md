# Endurance Ship's Log

> Call me **Parker**.
> 
>Some **months** ago - never mind how long precisely - having little or no money in my purse, and nothing in particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would **sail** about a little and see the **watery** part of the world.
>
> It is a way I have of **driving** off the spleen, and regulating the **circulation**. 

Thus, the **Endurance**.

The Endurance is a 37' sloop designed by Bill Buchan Sr. and John Buchan in the 1960s in Olympia, WA as a bluewater cruiser, first assembled in 1975. I bought it in August 2024 as a liveaboard as I finish my undergraduate degree at the University of Washington.
