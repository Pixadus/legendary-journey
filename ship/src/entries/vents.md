# 10/7/24 - Ventilation

The ideal vent on a boat gets air moving through the cabin of a boat, while keeping rain/seawater out. 

Endurance has three vents on it currently:

The mushroom ventilator is in a good location, so I'll replace it. The passive vents work okay but should probably have some way to prevent water from coming in with the air - but for now, I'll just replace the mushroom vent and add some ventilation to the head, which lacks it currently.

I settled on some [Vetus dorade boxes](https://www.fisheriessupply.com/vetus-denouden-dorade-boxes) that are designed to allow airflow while keeping back water. Montage time.
