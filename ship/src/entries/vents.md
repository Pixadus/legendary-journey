# 10/7/24 - Adding ventilation (part 1)

> I'll install the vents in this entry (part 1) - in part 2 I'll install fans and optimize the system.

The ideal vent on a boat gets air moving through the cabin of a boat, while keeping rain/seawater out. 

Endurance has three vents on it currently:

The stern and bow passive vents are in good locations, but won't move air on their own. The deck mushroom vent is ... really old, and barely qualifies as an active vent at this point. 

So without the hatches open, the air inside Endurance is still - a recipe for mold, condensation and stink. No bueno.

Considerations when looking for a new system:
- It's been recommended to [replace the air in the boat every hour](https://www.boatus.com/expert-advice/expert-advice-archive/2023/april/how-to-improve-ventilation-on-any-boat). 
- Seattle is in the PNW - around [150 days per year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle) we see at least 0.01in of rain, so vents need to let **air in** while keeping **rain out**.
- I have passive vents on the bow and stern.
- The ship's head is semi-sealed off, so also needs a vent.
- I don't want any areas of still air. 

I'd prefer to avoid drilling holes wherever possible, so will replace the old mushroom vent in the middle. I also want some ventilation in the ship's head, so will drill through the hatch and install one there. 

I settled on some [Vetus dorade boxes](https://www.fisheriessupply.com/vetus-denouden-dorade-boxes) that are designed to allow airflow while keeping back water.
