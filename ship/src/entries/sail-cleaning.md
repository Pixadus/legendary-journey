# 9/10/24 - Cleaning the mainsail

When we took the boat out a few days ago, it was the first time I caught a glimpse of the mainsail:

Oh, yeah. *Mildew, baby*. Lots of it, too. Now, North Sails, the manufacturer of my colorful, mildew-y sail, has a [few things to say on this](https://www.northsails.com/blogs/north-sails-blog/mildew-on-sails-what-to-do):

1. Mildew on sails doesn't affect the structural integrity of the sails.
2. Mildew occurs when the sail hasn't been taken out / aired out in a while in humid climates (i.e. everywhere on the ocean).
3. Mildew can be most easily cleaned with a diluted bleach solution.

> This third point only really applies to *Dacron* *sails*, which most standard mainsails are made of. Don't use bleach on Kevlar or nylon sails (like spinnakers).  

Yay for no structural integrity failures to tiny spores! Still - it's ugly. So, I decided to clean it. We took the sails down and off, then removed the battens (long flexible plastic supports within the sail), allowing us to fold it up for transport much easier. 

Now. Regarding cleaning. There are *so many* opinions on the best ways to go about this - [Practical Sailor](https://www.practical-sailor.com/boat-maintenance/quick-and-safe-sail-cleaning) wrote an article that tries to look at how cleaning agents will interact with the constituent mildew. TL;DR, Oxiclean is an effective solution for killing off mildew and is able to permeate through some of the surface resin on the sail to really get at the mildew beneath. [This thread](https://forums.sailinganarchy.com/threads/sail-cleaning.245695/#post-8647477)  has some good results from the treatment. 

I picked a 3 LB container of the Oxiclean powder from a local Fred Meyer, then filled a bathtub up with warm water. The container recommended a concentration of 1 scoop to each gallon; my bathtub fits about 45 gallons of water, and OxiClean recommends 0.25-1.0 of their "scoops" to each gallon. I put in 11 scoops to reach the low-concentration recommendation.

Not *exactly* scientific, but we do what we can.
