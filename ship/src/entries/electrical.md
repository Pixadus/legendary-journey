With the imminent arrival of winter cold + darkness in Seattle, I need to make sure Endurance has both heating to deal with the cold and lighting to deal with the darkness. 

And, since I've been meaning to rework Endurance's electrical system anyway, this is a good excuse. So - plans plans plans.
## Background

Endurance (like most boats) has two voltage supplies onboard: AC 120V and DC 12V. At the dock, power is supplied via a 30A 120V connection, for a total power of $30\;\text{A} * 120\;\text{V} = 3600\;\text{W}$. This power is connected to a battery charger, which charges the three onboard batteries, which are connected both directly to 12V appliances (through a fuse box) or a 120V AC inverter, which powers 120V accessories.

AC devices tend to be large and not something I want to run while underway, but are useful at shore, especially for university work and cooking without propane. 

The 12V DC systems are much more marine-oriented, and power fans, pumps, navigation and depth equipment and
