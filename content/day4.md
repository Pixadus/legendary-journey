We have two big things to address: the **cargo situation** and the **shutdown issue**. 

## Cargo

Let's start off with cargo. I think I may have been a *bit* overzealous in terms of what I can take - let's start with the absolute fundamentals. I'd like to get rid of the box up top and replace the saddlebags if possible. 

#### Needs

* **Camping gear**: Tent, sleeping bag, backpacking stove, stove fuel canister, pan/mug, headlamp. 
* **Work**: Laptop, charger, AUS-to-US adapter, phone. 
* **Entertainment**: Kindle, camera (200mm + 120mm lens), batteries, camera batt. charger.
* **Day-to-day**: Toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, spare pants, 2 pairs underwear, 2 pairs socks, spare shirt, fleece. 
* **Nutrition**: 3L camelbak w/ water, about 2L space for food. 

#### Wants

* **Work**: iPad for doodling. 
* **Entertainment**: DJI Mavic Mini 2, 600mm lens
* **Day-to-day**: One extra pair of clothes
* **Nutrititon**: An additional water bottle

**Camping gear** is all centralized in the Darche duffel, with the exception of the cooking gear and headlamp. If we get a folding pan and a reasonably-sized mug, it should occupy about 3.5 Macbook Airs' worth of space. 

If we just look at **needs** for now, I know that absolutely everything on that list (excepting camping gear) can fit with room to spare in the 60L container I have on hand. So, let's divvy it up into two smaller bags. We'll use one bag for soft and inexpensive stuff - clothing, nutrition and toiletries, and the other bag for hard stuff - camera, laptop/kindle, cables and chargers. 

I bet we could do this with two 30L containers. I really love the feel of the Tactix container I'm using now - and it looks like [Bunnings has a 30L version](https://www.bunnings.com.au/tactix-heavy-duty-storage-box-30l_p2583689). This would give us a waterproof, lockable container. The hard-stuff valuables crate we could pad with some foam padding - a brief search reveals this [blast from the past](https://www.bunnings.com.au/eva-50-x-50cm-interlock-foam-mats-solid-blue-pk4_p0126585) that could be cut up into smaller bits and glued to the sides of the crate. 

## Shutdown Issue

**The Problem**: The motorcycle's engine coughs, then looses power until RPMs reach zero and the engine dies. 

**Supporting observations**: These power losses do not, at a glance, seem to be correlated to speed or particular RPMs. When restarting the engine, the starter button needs to be held for a few moments. The engine turns over for much longer than it does when cold-starting before catching, usually taking between 3-6 seconds. 

**Hypotheses**: 
* The fuel system has dirt or debris in it - a fouled filter, a dirty carb, or the air intake tube is clogged. 
* The spark plugs are old.
