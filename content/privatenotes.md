## A Theory About Anxiety

I'd like to talk about **anxiety**. It's an emotion I think we are all familiar with to some degree - and I'd like to propose a theory on it. 

> Anxiety results from situations in which we feel powerless; confidence results from situations in which we feel powerful. 

In this, we present **anxiety** and **confidence** as opposing elements of a dichotomy - and, when I say 'power', I claim that *power* means the *ability to influence or control the outcome of a situation*. 

Further, this relevant only in situation in which you feel you have agency. I'm quite powerless to influence the orbit of Pluto, for instance, but it doesn't matter because I don't have any rights or abilities in telling Pluto what to do. 

Anxiety worsens as these situations in which you **both** hold agency and are feeling unable to influence outcomes are repeated; just as confidence **increases** as you are repeatedly able to influence outcomes **favorably**. 

## Thoughts on the Future

It's time I acknowledged the future. 

I think it would be nice to live a bit indefinitely, this life of travelling, reading and thinking. I am in control over this life, for how many surprises it tends to bring up - and that is comfortable. 

But - I'm 21 years old. I trust what I'm doing now is something useful to establish direction and purpose, but it is not a journey that should last forever. This is a time to understand how to live - what principals I'd like to guide my existence. And, hopefully, one to learn how to lead a life such that the depression that removed me from my previous two universities is not able to do so once more. 

So. The future. 

The AAS SPD conference, should our paper be accepted into proceedings, takes place on the 13th to 18th of August - and is, perhaps, a good time to return to the United States.

I will return to university in August or September - the University of Washington, if I am accepted as a direct transfer, or a community college in Washington followed by the UW. 

> The world of research is comfortable; a polite and withheld hug, a story told in buildings of brick and stone, the scratching of a pen and typing of a keyboard, a quiet excitement and a subdued, intense gaze.

## Thoughts

Do you ever have days that pass you by, and, you look back on them and see little? You lived, moment to moment, until all the moments passed and day turned to night and you reflect on an empty day.

There are also days that are long - they feel like they last weeks, months! Though, not all are bad. Some are beautiful - the best, filled with suffering and hope in equal amounts.

> [...] it makes no difference whether one is young in age or immature in character, for the deficiency doesnâ€™t come from the time, but from living in accord with feeling and following every impulse. (Nicomachean Ethics, p. 64)

To an extent, I think that's why travel can be so valuable. Times like these - they force experience on you, both unwelcome and welcome in nature, and force your days to be longer. 

Though, looking back, I wonder where the month of May has gone, for it is June already.

I'm worried I'm being too selfish with this journal. Self-centered; narcissistic. Oh man, I'm scared and anxious about this. 

But - this is a journal. 

A recording of thoughts and things learned. 

When I started on this journey, I'd been pretty successful at destroying my Self, out of anxiety, fear and lack of purpose and direction. Spinning in circles, faster and faster until everything had fallen off. 

I don't exist. Didn't. 

I like to think I'm learning how to rebuild.

So, if these thoughts seem self-centered sometimes ... I'd ask your forgiveness. I'm trying to re-understand how to Live, and I'd ask your patience throughout that.

Does the quality of a book scale proportionally with the caliber and quantity of complex characters? If so, I'll need to name my future characters variations on the mathematical constant $ i $.

I'm going to trust that what I'm doing now is worthwhile - that I'm not an idle tourist, a pampered son. 

Meaning is, fundamentally, what you give to things. I am going to trust that this journey is meaningful - I'm going to trust that I can learn to change through this. To grow as a person. 

Trust yourself. Trust in your self, trust your mind, trust your thoughts.

You don't have enough time to second-guess everything. 

I'm going to trust in you, reader, if you're reading this.
