## Camping Prep

I'm in Townsville now - this is the last time I'll have easy access to a wide variety of stores, including supermarkets and camping stores - so it's a good idea to set up a packing list now.

Staying for 4 days (10:00 AM 28th to 5 PM 1st) - so, 4 lunches, 3 dinners, 3 breakfast (4?) - a total of 7 full meals, 3-4 breakfasts. 

Wisdom says I should have some extra leeway in meals just in case of storm or unforseen circumstance, so let's budget 1 more day - 8-9 full meals, 5 breakfasts. 

### Food

**Meals**:
- *camping pizzas*: english muffins, tomato sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni - 2 meals per pack, 6 meals with 3 packs
  - req: frying pan, stove, fuel, oil, pan topper (foil)
- *pasta*: pasta, parmesean, tomato sauce - 3 meals per pack
  - req: pot, stove, fuel, plate, spork

**Potential meals**: (eval at store)
- *dry cereal*: bag of dry cereal - 4 breakfasts per pack
  - req: pot/cup/bowl
- *muffins*: 2 days & snack
- *protein bars*: 4+ days
- *granola/oats*: 4+ days

**Note** - need cleaning microfiber cloth. Have one in bag - need to wash.

**Snacks**:
- *grapes*: ~2 days rationed
- *crackers*: ~2 days
- *jerky*: 4+ days
- *protein bars*: 4+ days

### Necessary Gear

- [x] Stove
- [ ] 2 canisters butane (have 1x)
- [ ] 2 gal water
- [ ] Camping kitchen set (incl. min. pot, pan & cup)

So - need to buy another fuel canister, some water and a camp set. Let's get the water at 1770 - transporting that far on Stylo will be a pain.
