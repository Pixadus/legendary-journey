## Packing

Got to 1770, immediately deployed my swag on the floor of the hostel and scattered gear about the room.

Here's what we got. 

Foodwise, two packs of english muffins, some overexpensive tomato sauce, protein-rich chocolate serial, shredded mozzarella, this huge cheap jar of sliced peaches, a pack of arnott's biscuits and some pasta. 

Packed the "safe goods" in one bag, and the "explodey goods" in another - separated by a nigh-impregnable box of waterproofed goods (pasta + biscuits in plastic).
