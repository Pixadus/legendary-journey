# Diagnostics

Okay, so we have a set of tracings over the full H-alpha timeseries. 

Simultaneously with the observations of the H-alpha linewidth, we also observed the Doppler velocities of the H-alpha core line & the core intensity, and the [bisector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisection) velocity (presumably of the line width - not sure how velocity can be measured. Checking now.)
