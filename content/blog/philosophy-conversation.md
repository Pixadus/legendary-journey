This entry is only lightly going to reference sources - rather, most of this entry will be writing about anecdotal thoughts on conversing and being social. 

I hazard you that it therefore should be contextualized as part of a narrative, rather than representative of the thoughts of those with more education of thought than I. 


# Regarding Talking

I just played in a chess tournament. "Played", is, of course, overemphasizing the reality of things. I lost the first tourney round. In a blaze of glory, I had his king chase mine for perhaps a dozen rounds. It wasn't close, but was dramatic. 

I got into conversations with some people both before and after this tournament - conversations that lasted a while, acknowledged appropriate social cues, ended on good notes. Conversations that, for all intents and purposes, were **adequately done**. 

And, looking back, I feel pretty shitty about them.

By the standards of "how to talk with people" - I usually have the conversational skill of a 17th century English lady of high standing discussing the latest developments in the weather of London. 

Polite, attentive, and **boring** as **hell**. 

So, this got me thinking. I anticipate verbosity in the following paragraphs - read if you think it relevant, and skip if you're disinterested. These thoughts are consequences of my lived experiences, rather than peer-reviewed research.

## Social Anxiety

Before we talk about a good conversation, let's talk about **social anxiety**. Oh boy, I know - this isn't a fun topic. But it *is* an interesting one. 

Let's first define anxiety. I would like to present anxiety as part of a dichotomy:

![Anxiety dichotomy](/images/svg/anxietyscale.svg)

**Overconfidence** and **anxiety** are both extreme "static conditions", and are semi-permanant (longer lasting) the more extreme to each side you get. 

- **Overconfidence** is a state where you are confident enough in your own skills to the point where you ignore new developments. 
  - Developed by repeated "good" results, leading to a blind faith that results from this skill will *always* be good (the invention of a mental "law" governing continued good results). 
- **Anxiety** occurs when you lack confidence in a skill to the point where you are left questioning every single occurrence. 
  - Brought about by repeated skill exercises not measuring up to expectations ("bad experiences"), and/or avoidance of the use of that skill as a result of the bad feelings anxiety brings. 

The "beautiful" or "optimum" point lies somewhere between these - when you are "competent" at a skill. This is a state where you are ready to respond to new developments, while still trusting your own abilities enough to take pleasure from performing the skill. 

> Imagine these skills first in the context of an airline pilot, then in the context of social skills. Is it good to have an anxious airline pilot? An overconfident pilot? The answer seems to be somewhere in between - a competent pilot. 

The optimum point, in my experience, is ... difficult to achieve, especially when you've spent time at one extreme end of the dichotomy. Multiple good experiences following a long time of anxiety might lead to a temporary, fragile overconfidence, whereas several bad experiences while overconfident can lead to a bombastic anxiousness. Also - by solidifying "anxiety" and "confidence" as concrete ideas that we can identify with, we further reinforce their presence as "elements of Self" or "parts of our personality". 

> I'm just an anxious person / I'm horrible at being alone! / I am NOT a people person omg

If we remain in this dichotomy, it seems that only by being **intentional** and **deliberate** with our actions (being conscious of new developments while also playing on what went well in the past) can we stably stick at the "competence point". This dichotomy view is likely a consequence of my readings on Nicomachean Ethics - from the [Stanford article on Aristotelian Ethics](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-ethics/),

> [...] every ethical virtue is a condition intermediate (a “golden mean” as it is popularly known) between two other states, one involving excess, and the other deficiency (1106a26–b28). In this respect, Aristotle says, the virtues are no different from technical skills: every skilled worker knows how to avoid excess and deficiency, and is in a condition intermediate between two extremes. The courageous person, for example, judges that some dangers are worth facing and others not, and experiences fear to a degree that is appropriate to his circumstances. He lies between the coward, who flees every danger and experiences excessive fear, and the rash person, who judges every danger worth facing and experiences little or no fear. Aristotle holds that this same topography applies to every ethical virtue [...]

In Aristotelian ethics, then, the point of "competence" is the "virtue point" between excess and deficiency.

Now. How this applies to being social. 

**Social anxiety**, if we use this framework, is a consequence of conversations and social engagements repeatedly not measuring up to what we expect as "good" results. 

Conversations that feel awkward, interactions with friends and family that fall short of what we wish them to be, even discussions with total strangers that go awry can contribute. 

> Zen. I am totally zen. This morning is so beautiful and good, ocean, birds, I wonder if the wetsuit will fit alright and maybe the bay is going to be- "Hello!" the barista smiles at me. My thoughts stop. Brain rebooting. One second. Need to get something out. Panic mode. "Hi, good morning, um, hello! Are you ... the ... person ... I am ordering from?" Graceful, wow, nice one.

Interactions like this one. Was I tired? Sure - I'd woken up a few minutes before. Did I expect better of myself? Quite. I'd wanted to slide in, order a coffee, and not remember a single thing standing out. Instead, I have this - learning experience - of a conversation to recall here. 

I'm quite aware that this is normal - and fine. But, broadly speaking I've spent a lot of time on the anxious part of the above spectrum - it's easy to fall back into.
