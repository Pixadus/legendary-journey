Hello, you -

Following the news about the tent theft, I've recieved assistance from so many unexpected quarters - sufficient to fully recover from the loss of it.  

I do not know how to adequately express my graditude for this generosity. Which sucks, because I want to hug each and every one of you and laugh and cry. 

It'll have to suffice to do so later. 

Thank you, all of you. Your kindness means the world to me.

Australia seems to have a thing about huge libraries.

Better if made entirely from stone and marble; and even moreso if they boast ionic columns out front and have all the regality of an ancient palace of old.

Yes, yes. The first place I went to after arriving was a library. Stop laughing. 

Seriously, though? Libraries are **awesome**, Australian libraries doubly so. 

1. Free wifi
2. They smell like books and you have several lifetimes' worth of free entertainment around you, all the time
3. Knowledge!
4. You feel regal just by association

**Later**

I met up with a friend, Josh, here in Sydney, for some pizza and to tour **VIVID, Sydney** - a light show and cultural presentation of colossal intent put on by New South Wales.

<div class="gallery">
    <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52946639919_1740af57ae_o_d.jpg" data-ngthumb="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52946639919_23a520b873_c_d.jpg"></a>
</div>

Josh was *wonderful* to hang out with. A student of computer science at the University of Victoria in Canada, and a witty and intelligent conversationalist, we discussed elements of the educational system, society, reflection and preponderance of the future (Also, Josh, if you're reading this, let it be remembered we have a Mario Kart game to compete in here soon).

Following dinner at a fancy and exceptionally delicious pizzaria (where they put straws in the ginger beer bottles?), we headed to tour the lightshow.

The organizers of VIVID were *not* screwing around. They wanted to put on a lightshow to wow and amaze, and they accomplished it with gusto.

Many of the largest and most famous buildings along the coast, including the [Sydney Harbor Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge) and [Opera House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Opera_House) were bedecked and projected upon with a true variety of light sources. Creativity was sought in all things, and vision encouraged.

I'm hoping to return tomorrow - I haven't used my flying camera yet, and hope to see some of these presentations from different angles.

**Sydney, June 3rd 12:58 PM**

Okay. Day of departure - and with it, the crucial information you've been waiting for.

The two **best coffee shops** in Sydney are:

1. [GrindHouse](https://goo.gl/maps/Gg3Bhd6w4c9bnbcX6?coh=178573&entry=tt) - good coffee, excellent muffins, hearts with foam. 
2. [Part One Coffee](https://goo.gl/maps/FJJRSu8FK8mD7bMj7?coh=178573&entry=tt) - pretty good coffee and a cozy place to sit in back to read and to work. 

Bye, Sydney.
