# Stylo

I woke up in 1770, and drove for 7 hours to get back to Brisbane, trying to beat the rainstorm forecasted for the next few days. It was ... exhausting, but, fortunately, mostly uneventful - except at the end.

Around 150 kilometers out, one of the bolts on the luggage crates sheared.

Right? 6 millimeters of solid stainless steel, *crack*. 

Now, if I were NASA, I'd drop everything and replace all the bolts. One failure means they're ALL bad better make sure that's absolutely not the case. Fortunately, I'm not NASA - so I had some maneuvering room. I've been carrying my tools & spare bolts with me throughout this ride. I removed the old bolt after some hammering and swearing, then inserted the new. (While repairing it, I got a total of 4 offers from 3 outback-looking dudes and 1 outback-looking lady to "take 'er to the shop, we'll fix you up!" in that hour at the gas station. So rad.)

I started to close the rest of the distance between myself and Brisbane - until, 100 kilometers out, **disaster**. 

Traffic was at a **complete** standstill! It was hot as hell! I was irritated after 6 hours of riding and ready with all the force of a Hobbit who'd gone without breakfast for food. 

> It'd been minutes. Minutes! Not an inch! What! God it smells like exhaust and stink and - you know, nope, I'm done. I sit up, start Stylo's engine, and pull over to the shoulder, driving along at a steady clip of 30 km/h beside the broad freeway.

> I became aware of a steady rumble, different from the buzz of Stylo. Stylo's a quiet bike, so that must mean- I check the mirrors. Sure enough, there's a leather jacket-wielding lady on a motorbike behind me. And one behind her. Followed by three others. I was leading a motorcycle gang. Oh my.

We continued on the shoulder for maybe 15 kilometers, before the shoulder disappeared due to construction. By then, traffic had started moving again, albeit slowly - and the small gang gradually dispersed into traffic, though the lady on the bike stuck with me nearly all the way to Brisbane. 

She gave me a wave as we took separate exits. 

I'm not sure if I'm ever going to achieve that level of cool-by-association again.

And ... I'm back in Brisbane. Stylo's up on the marketplace. Cleaned up and looking amazing.

I don't tend to get attached to a lot of material objects, but cars and motorbikes are mechanically complex enough that they easily gain personalities - especially old ones that you grow to know. 

Bye, Stylo.

# Year 22

Today, I've officially survived 22 of Earth's orbital periods around the sun. 

8035 days + 12 hours. 694,267,200 seconds. Sol has completed $9.6*10^{-6}$ percent of a complete revolution around the Milky Way in this time. 

I still don't, even after so much time, know what I'm supposed to do around here on Earth. What truths there are - words to speak, who to be, people to love and how to balance confidence with arrogance and humility with modesty. 

There are days that I feel anxious and horrible. Days that are filled with music and wonder. Days that pass and seem not to exist at all; turnings of Earth, like an empty record, that skip a track. 

Yet ...

> You are a ship; a vessel designed for the seas, sleek and pointy and blunt and awkward and graceful all at once.
>
> You are hurtling across the ocean, forever propelled by the winds of purpose and your own momentum. 
>
> There are days where the winds falter.
> 
> Days where your compass is invisible in the darkness, so you go in circles.
>
> Days where you feel surrounded by impenetrable fog, and despair.
>
> Yet, the ocean is vast. To get to where you seek, you must push on. You will go off course and lose your way; but the measure of the distance you have travelled always is never only a straight line. 

I intend to reach that distant horizon. 

If love is the answer.
