# Timelapses

I've been wanting to record the wheel of a moving vehicle for a *long* time now. That low to the ground you have a unique perspective on the movement of the road, and the frame-cuts from racing television near the wheel always give this rush of speed.

A long stretch of road from 1770 to Rockhampton -

And, clouds over some recent days have been stunning - this far away from most major cities, there isn't a lot of smog to tint the air - so the contrast between cloud and sky remains fantastically sharp sometimes.

# The Journey

## 1770

A car just crashed into a parked car outside of our hostel. The driver, an old man, was uninjured - claimed to have been blinded by the high-beams of an oncoming car - but the left side of his car was flattened. Elsewhere in the world we may have been met by death rather than life.

I've been hesitant to think about the future for a while. I felt it time to do so today.

In two months, I should like to publish a paper, attend university, get back into classes, hike a lot and meet new people. I want to ask a girl I've known for some time out and try to live a life not dictated by fear. Improv, photography, racing clubs, building things and trying to live a life Done Well and Lived Well. 

There is the possibility that my headspace will sink again. Maybe not just a possibility alone. I should expect it to happen, and prepare myself appropriately for it. A big part of this journey has been trying to equip myself with the mental foundations and toolsets appropriate for a good life - and maybe part of a good life is being able to get through the bad parts. 

... and, sorry. I've been dancing around the topic of depression with euphamisms and allusions for a long time now. I shouldn't - it's solemn enough of a topic worth being direct about, but -

Hah! Finally. I've been looking to get some Nolan in here somehow. 90% it is. 

Anyway. More on the future soon. Until then, I will concern myself with the present, which has much in store. Tomorrow, I'm driving up to Airlie Beach - or trying to - which lies 5 hours away. Longest drive yet. 

My derriére is ready ✊

# Now-Truths

> Aim for calm stability, when unsure how to be.

This seems to be a good state of hexis from which to interact with the world. 

---

> Esse quam videri - to be, rather than to seem. 

You are not what you do not do - and you are what you do. Claiming a quality or trait that you do not act is disingenuous. 

Strive to be that which you identify with. 

---

> Understand who you are. Don't let others tell you so.

It is so, so, so easy to change yourself to accord to the desires and wishes of others. 

These desires and wishes aren't only those consciously or explicitly expressed - but subtle expectations that you don't see until you find you're bound to them as strongly as with steel chain. 

Talking about this more later.
