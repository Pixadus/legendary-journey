## Year 22

Today, I've officially survived 22 of Earth's orbital periods around the sun. 

8035 days + 12 hours. 694,267,200 seconds. Sol has completed $9.56522*10^{-6}$% of a complete revolution around the Milky Way in this time. 

I still don't, even after so much time, know what I'm supposed to do around here on Earth. What truths there are - words to speak, who to be, people to love and how to balance confidence with arrogance and humility with modesty. 

There are days that I feel anxious and horrible. Days that are filled with music and wonder. Days that pass and seem not to exist at all; turnings of Earth, like an empty record, that skip a track. 

Yet ...

> You are a ship; a vessel designed for the seas, sleek and pointy and blunt and awkward and graceful all at once.
>
> You are hurtling across the ocean, forever propelled by the winds of purpose and your own momentum. 
>
> There are days where the winds falter.
> 
> Days where your compass is invisible in the darkness, so you go in circles.
>
> Days where you feel surrounded by impenetrable fog, and despair.
>
> Yet, the ocean is vast. To get to where you seek, you must push on. You will go off course and lose your way; but the measure of the distance you have travelled always is never only a straight line. 

I intend to reach that distant horizon. 

If love is the answer, after all.
