Tomorrow, I'm going to start off again. 

> Thoughts of my last attempt filter through my mind. I feel my heart speed up just a bit. Ugh. 

I'll head east, following the A1 and side roads, though I'd like to demo the M1 and see how the bike reacts to the highway.

Targeting a shorter journey for now - leaving plenty of time to find a place to sit and log a bit of work in there, as well as the opportunity to arrive at my destination while it's still light out. 

## Questions

I've been thinking about purpose a lot over the past few days. 

This journey, adventure of mine - I don't want to give it a clear destination. That's been the idea all along - the journey should be the goal inherent in itself. Take things as they come. But that idea has some caveats. 

No matter what, once I finish this, I can't allow it to be for nothing. I don't want to be an idle tourist, purposeless and adrift. My greatest fear is looking back on this trip and thinking "it was nice, but ultimately a waste of time". 

So. Questions. Questions I'd like to answer along the way, or start formulating answers to.

* What do I give a shit about? 
* Where do I want to be? Later this year? 20 years from now?
* What's important in the world? 
* How can I be the best person I possibly can be? Is there a difference between that person and the person I am now?
* Where is my depression coming from? What could I do to address the origin? 

Refining ...

* What do I care about?
* Where do I want to be?
* What's important?
* What is better and how can I get there?

Aristotle & co. will help for the last question. The first three are ones that I think I can only address by thought, reading, writing and action. I think each question deserves its own answer - something I'm not prepared to give as of yet, though I have some guiding ideas. 

And, one last thing.
