## Take Two

Tomorrow, I'm going to start off again. 

> Thoughts of my last attempt filter through my mind. I feel my heart speed up just a bit. Ugh. 

I'll head east, following the A1 and side roads, though I'd like to demo the M1 and see how the bike reacts to the highway.

Targeting a shorter journey for now - leaving plenty of time to find a place to sit and log a bit of work in there, as well as the opportunity to arrive at my destination while it's still light out. 

My posts from now are probably going to become a bit scattered, as I can't anticipate what the coming days will look like. I promise to take a lot of pictures for you though. 

## Questions

I've been thinking about purpose a lot over the past few days. 

This journey, adventure of mine - I don't want to give it a clear destination. That's been the idea all along - the journey should be the goal inherent in itself. Take things as they come. But that idea has some caveats. 

No matter what, once I finish this, I can't allow it to be for nothing. I don't want to be an idle tourist, purposeless and adrift. My greatest fear is looking back on this trip and thinking "it was nice, but ultimately a waste of time". 

So. Questions. Questions I'd like to answer along the way, or start formulating answers to.

* What things actually matter?
* Where do I want to be? Later this year? 20 years from now?
* What's important in the world? 
* How can I be the best person I possibly can be? Is there a difference between that person and the person I am now?
* Where is my depression coming from? What could I do to address the origin? 

Refining ...

* What do I care about?
* Where do I want to be?
* What's important?
* What is better and how can I get there?

Aristotle & co. will help for the last question. The first three are ones that I think I can only address by thought, reading, writing and action. I think each question deserves its own answer - something I'm not prepared to give as of yet, though I have some guiding ideas. 

That said ... I've been thinking a lot about where I want to be. And I have some really clear ideas right now.

Dream life? Right now? I want to be doing **research**. Or tinkering with some fascinating front-line engineering projects - building Martian probes and rovers or sending stuff into deep space. 

Space, is, the final frontier. It offers nearly limitless possiblity, and in an optimistic world so much of humanity's future is going to be dedicated to it. And space is *fucking awesome*, excuse my French but it's true.
