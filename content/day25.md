Hello, you -

Following the news about the tent theft, I've recieved assistance from so many unexpected quarters - sufficient to fully recover from the loss of it, and then some. 

I do not know how to adequately express my graditude for this generosity. Which sucks, because I want to hug each and every one of you and laugh and cry. 

It'll have to suffice to do so later. 

Thank you, all of you. Your kindness means the world to me.

## The Journey

Australia seems to have a thing about huge, grand state libraries.

**Later**

I met up with a friend, Josh, here in Sydney, for some pizza and to tour **VIVID, Sydney** - a light show and cultural presentation of colossal intent put on by New South Wales.

Josh was *wonderful* to hang out with. A student of computer science at the University of Victoria in Canada, and a witty and intelligent conversationalist, we discussed elements of the educational system, society, reflection and preponderance of the future (Also, Josh, if you're reading this, let it be remembered we have a Mario Kart game to compete in here soon).

Following dinner at a fancy and exceptionally delicious pizzaria (where they put straws in the ginger beer bottles?), we headed to tour the lightshow.

The organizers of VIVID were *not* screwing around. They wanted to put on a lightshow to wow and amaze, and they accomplished it with gusto.

Many of the largest and most famous buildings along the coast, including the [Sydney Harbor Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour_Bridge) and [Opera House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Opera_House) were bedecked and projected upon with a true variety of light sources. Creativity was sought in all things, and vision encouraged.

I'm hoping to return tonight once more - I haven't used my flying camera yet, and hope to see some of these presentations from different angles.

It is rare to have found such a beautiful soul.

Farewell, Estraven.
