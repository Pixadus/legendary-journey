> I pull out a chair in the library and sit, exhausted. A strong whiff of gasoline drifts past my nose. I stink. But there's an underlying sense of satisfaction beneath it. I glance around the table. Nobody close. Good. 

Today was officially a good day for one very good reason: I've officially made it to two of the three categories of ownership!

**Blood**, **sweat** and ~~**tears**~~. 

I've sweated. It's hot and humid here. Today marked the first occasion of blood; I banged up my knuckles while trying to convince a stubborn hose onto an inlet. No tears yet, though I came awful close to them a bit ago.

Maybe two out of three is enough?

Anyway. Sorry, dear reader, for the delay - I've been spending most of my time reading and catching up on work, with a bit of socializing here and there. 

I fear my work may not be of interest to most of you; so I'll avoid talking about it in the main gist here. But, if you decide you are indeed interested in the nitty gritty of feature recognition in images, [I'll be keeping track of it here](https://blog.andromeda.is/work/). 

City pictures!

## Motorcycle

I'm a bit embarrassed here - I got the tank off the bike for the first time today and did my first deep inspection. Turns out, *nope*, there's **definitely** a carbureator. My EFI dreams will remain just that for now. 

The carb was in good condition; I didn't get into the float bowl as that would have required more disassembly than I was willing to get into, but things were clean as far as I could tell. I'm hoping to avoid doing a full carb disassembly; but if I have to I will. 

I suspect I might know what the issue may be, though.

In a fuel tank, as fuel drains it needs to be replaced by something to avoid a vaccuum. That *something* tends to be air - it's supplied through the fuel vent hose. 

![Fuel tank diagram](/images/svg/fuel-venting.svg)

This fuel vent hose was, interestingly enough, disconnected. The connector for the hose was rusted over. 

**Problem**: motorcycle periodically (and randomly) dies. This death is characteristic of running out of fuel. 

**Hypothesis**: this death is caused by a (small) clog in the **vent hose**. The creation of a vaccuum in the tank would would lead to the cylinders not being able to get sufficient fuel - hence - death by fuel starvation.

**Supporting ideas**: 
* Air wouldn't be able to get into the fuel tank to equalize pressure with the fuel. This clog might not be total - air must be getting in somehow, otherwise the deaths would be more common. 
* The previous owner of the bike said he replaced the fuel cap from a vented version to one that isn't - i.e. one that allowed air in to one that didn't. 
* Whenever I remove the gas cap, there's a slight *pop* of inrushing air. Indicating there's some pressure inside. 

**Solution idea**: Make the cap a vented version. 

A wire coat hanger sticking across the seal of the cap would work; or, we drill a small hole in the base of the current gas cap, let it vent through the keyhole. 

The drill idea would be ideal. Let's try it out tomorrow. 

In other news, I was feeling like the DIY sads are a *bit* janky. Not full jank - maybe just, like, 28% jank. I'm worried the M10 bolts are going to somehow disengage from the bike frame which would lead to the crates falling. 

Solution?

**Paracord**. Right up there with duct tape and towels in terms of usefulness.

If the crates come loose from the main frame, the other side will support it - at least until I can come to a safe stop and figure out something long term from there. It's not a perfect solution, but it takes me from 28% jank to ~11% jank.
