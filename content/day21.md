Hi again. 

Some of you have been wondering about a notification system - trust me, I've been thinking about it for a bit too. 

I decided against it on the ride here today. Our lives are filled up with so many things *constantly* demanding our attention. Texts, calls, email, pop-up notifications and social media and correspondance and "hey, shop here!" ...

I don't want this journal to demand attention. 

This should be, I hope, a familiar presence - a home, for thoughts and dreams. 

This post, as I'm intending to be the case later on, is divided between the Journey and, later, just some pictures along the way. 

Thank you for sticking with me this far. Sorry if I'm delayed in responding. Tomorrow, I'm hoping to sit down and spend some time corresponding. 

## The Journey

**Bateman's Bay, May 29 1:57 PM**

<iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=150.12147903442386%2C-35.754174601741504%2C150.23820877075198%2C-35.66664072715776&amp;layer=mapnik&amp;marker=-35.71041968092548%2C150.1798439025879" style="border: 1px solid black"></iframe>

It's **warm**! Freaking FINALLY. 

I've been driving in a balmy **18.6** deg C, which is about **65.48** deg F. 

Yeah, I know, that doesn't sound nearly as warm as I make it out to be. But, trust me it is *infinitely* better than driving with *summer edition perforated leather gloves on sale for only 99.99 AUD!* in 40 deg F weather. That gets really cold and really old, quickly. 

Anyway. Enough of my complaining. Sitting down with my favorite ultra-dark-themed editor to do some work. 

I'm about 4 hours 30 minutes out from Sydney! I think I might be able to get there by tomorrow afternoon, if I ride hard.

Check these nerds out. 

I really love kangaroos. They're quiet and peaceful. They keep to themselves, and tend to maintain a distance from human civilization. I hope to see more of them over the coming weeks. 

Also - I'm realizing I haven't gotten a good shot of my camping setup since day 1 - so, behold:

Cozy. Nice views of the stars, when they're out, and it's good at dealing with all the elements I've run into so far. 

**Note to self**: need a better pillow.

I've outdone myself.

Every single campground I've stayed at thus far? **Totally** blown out of the water. 

<div class="gallery">
    <a href="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52936027652_ae2708d469_k_d.jpg" data-ngthumb="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52936027652_9a606341e6_c_d.jpg"></a>

Of course, I should mention that last night's wasn't necessarily a *campground*, per se. To be honest I was the legal definition of a squatter. 

> A squatter is an individual who occupies a property for which they have no right, legal claim, or lease agreement. 

But that's not important. What is important is that **I got away with it**, with style and panache, along with some nice pictures of stars, sunsets, sunrises and, check this out:

Dolphins! 

I didn't expect their chirping to be audible from so far away, but oh my it was. 

I was setting up to get going after taking a lot of shots around the beach, when I found my first case of **random stuff falling off of Stylo**. 

Care to join me for a game of "What's missing from the following picture?" (ignore Australia showing off her beaches for a second).

Check out the back. Yeah. I don't see it either. 

Looks like at some point between Cann River and Ulladulla my license plate fell off. 

Honestly? Of all the things I was expecting to fall off, the license plate was **definitely** not it. 

Anyway. I got in touch with the Victorian police just to let them know it's missing so it doesn't get used for nefarious purposes, but there isn't much I can do about it up here - other than, of course, scribbling my rego number on a piece of cardboard and duct-taping that to Stylo. 

I swear, if this thing isn't held together by duct tape, zip ties and pure will by Cairns I'm not going jank enough.

**Sydney, May 30, 3:20 PM**

<iframe width="425" height="350" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="https://www.openstreetmap.org/export/embed.html?bbox=151.1840629577637%2C-33.888800001124395%2C151.24242782592776%2C-33.84404334199873&amp;layer=mapnik&amp;marker=-33.86642460450752%2C151.2132453918457" style="border: 1px solid black"></iframe>

Made it to Sydney. 

> Sleep sounds so good. Or food. Or rest. Reading. I don't quite know what I want, but I want it. 

First impressions? Motorcycle parking in Sydney is **a lie**. There is no parking. That sounds dramatic, I know. Let me explain. 

**1:05 PM**: I thank the receptionist at Nomads Sydney for his directions and hop on the bike, heading for a motorcycle parking recommendation. 

**1:10 PM**: Recommended lot was full. 

> This is literally a motorcycle parking lot the size of a gas station and it's bike-to-bike filled! Overfilled! They're spilling out onto the street!

**1:30 PM**: I've patrolled the majority of streets in the CBD and every single bike parking spot was over-crammed with scooters and bikes. 

**1:40 PM**: Streets around the huge park containing the Sydney museum ... Nothing there.

**1:45 PM**: The Sydney Museum has a huge sign that reads *"**Parking**: more than you can afford"* (paraphrased).

**2:10 PM**: Fuck it.

I'm not going to tell you where I parked - nor, I'm afraid, am I going to discuss the legality of it. I apologize, but you must settle for the idea that Stylo is safely, securely parked and is *probably* not going to be towed, mostly because it's in a very inconvenient spot for a tow truck. 

Also, I lost my license plate. So HAH. Take **that**, Sydney!

In Melbourne, they solved the motorbike parking issue by just saying "PARK ANYWHERE!" (Seriously, if it's a sidewalk and/or you're not blocking traffic flow, it's free game). 

Anyways. Enough of my ranting. 

I regret to announce that I'm going to abandon my \$100 experiment, for now.

Since it's the end of the month, insurance is due. Hostels are a bit pricy, and, probably most importantly (though of debatable necessity), I'd like to be socially active while I'm here - which is more challenging to do cheaply in the city than in the countryside. 

Some of you have been really sweet and sponsored me until my next paycheck comes in. I don't want to make this adventure out of charity - so apologies if I reject your donation, I know it's with good intent - but I really, really appreciate it regardless. 

Written word can't effectively say how much. 

Here's a heart on fire. I hope it suffices for now. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•
